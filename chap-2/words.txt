Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences
of pattern in string by the replacement repl. If the pattern isnâ€™t found,
string is returned unchanged. repl can be a string or a function; if it is a string,
any backslash escapes in it are processed. That is, \n is converted to a single
newline character, \r is converted to a carriage return, and so forth.
Unknown escapes of ASCII letters are reserved for future use and treated as errors.
Other unknown escapes such as \& are left alone. Backreferences, such as \6,
are replaced with the substring matched by group 6 in the pattern
